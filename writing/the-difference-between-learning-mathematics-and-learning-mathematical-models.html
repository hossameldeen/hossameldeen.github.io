The Difference Between Learning Mathematics and Learning Mathematical Models
=============================================================================

Mohamed Gamal taught us Depth-First Search before he taught us graphs. When he
taught it to us, it was just a solution to a problem: Find your your way out of
a maze.

Are graphs important? Are sets important? Are matrices important?

They are. To someone facing problems whose solutions can be much more easily found
by modeling them as graph/set/matrix problems. But to the rest, they're no
different from memorizing trivia of history & programming languages.

So, yes, I stress: teaching graphs/sets/matrices to people whose life won't be
enhanced by learning them is no different from teaching anything else to people
whose life won't be enhanced by learning them.

Graphs, sets, and matrices are not Mathematics. They're Mathematical models. Anyone
can invent Mathematical models just as anyone can invent programming languages, and
learning a programming language for the sake of merely increasing a number on a
resume, as we know, is absolutely meaningless.

Yet, Mathematics are important to be learnt. And that leaves us with a question, if
we don't teach sets, what are going to teach?

To answer this, we first need to answer: What is Mathematics? Allow me to go overboard
and answer the question.

Mathematics, to me, is about two things: Abstraction and Logic. Yes, thinking is not
only about that, there's the decomposition thinking, deductive thinking, ...etc. But
Mathematics, to me, is about Abstraction Logic.

Abstraction, if you're lucky, is about seeing the core a problem. And in all cases, it's
about ignoring details that have little influence on a problem. Color of a car, usually,
has little influence on the speed it moves with or the friction it makes (Note: not an
engineer here). It's about limit the scope of what you're talking about instead of
wandering randomly between hypotheses?
And you know what happens when you abstract? You find commonalities, you reach the
Mathematical models! You find that searching in a maze is the same as trying all patterns
on a lock.

Logic is, in my first thought, about truth. How to make sure the conclusions we reach
from playing with our Mathematical models are actually true?

So, yes, it's important to teach these two to knowledge workers, I assume. But
teaching Mathematical models is not teaching them, it's no different from teaching the
stupidest of stupid subjects you learned in school.

So, the TL;DR:

- Never teach a Mathematical model without an application important to the learners.
- Teach Logic.
- Teach people to make their thinking more organized with Abstraction.
